            <p class="pvr">The significance of providing stimulation during the early years of a child's life is sometimes significantly undervalued. This is when your child is most receptive and malleable, with their brain developing over 90%. This period is marked by a continuous evolution of intellectual curiosity, rendering it the most influential and defining phase in your child's life.</p>
